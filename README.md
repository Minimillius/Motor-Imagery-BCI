# Motor-Imagery-BCI
This code implement a Motor Imagery task, using multiclass CSP and SVM.

This code classify multi-class Motor Imagery task.

The pipeline is as follows:

-Filtering the data in Mu and Beta band.

-Implementation of k-fold method.

-Extracting Common Spatial Pattern coefficients.

-Using CSP Coefs to extract features.

-Classification with Support Vector Machine algorithm.
